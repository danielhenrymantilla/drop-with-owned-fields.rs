The [`#[drop_with_owned_fields]`][`drop_with_owned_fields`] attribute of this crate automates and
encapsulates the process of wrapping the fields of a struct in [`ManuallyDrop`], which is typically
needed when having the intention to [`drop()`-in-place][`ManuallyDrop::drop()`] a certain field
before others are, or when actually needing to [`take`][`ManuallyDrop::take()`] full, owned, access
to that field. These two operations are `unsafe`, despite the notorious soundness of the whole
pattern, which is quite unfortunate. The objective of this crate is to properly identify and
automate this "notoriously sound" pattern, so as to expose a _safe and sound_ API for users to take
advantage of, with all the power of the type system supporting them and gently nudging them away
from bugs.

## Examples

### Example: `Defer<impl FnOnce()>`

Take, for instance, the following, rather typical, example:

```rust ,compile_fail
struct Defer<F: FnOnce()> {
    f: F,
};

impl<F: FnOnce()> Drop for Defer<F> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        (self.f)() // Error, cannot move out of `self.f` which is behind a mutable reference
    }
}
```

Alas, our usage of the correct `FnOnce()` bound (since we only need to call it once) has made this
snippet fail!

  - Full error message:

    ```

    </span>

    </details>

Enter [`#[drop_with_owned_fields]`][`drop_with_owned_fields`]:

```rust
# fn main() {}
#
use ::drop_with_owned_fields::drop_with_owned_fields;

#[drop_with_owned_fields]
struct Defer<F: FnOnce()> {
    f: F,
}

#[drop_with_owned_fields]
impl<F: FnOnce()> Drop for Defer<F> {
    fn drop(Self { f }: _) {
        f(); // âœ…
    }
}
```

Note that the second usage of [`#[drop_with_owned_fields]`][`drop_with_owned_fields`] on that
`impl Drop` block is only supported by enabling the `"drop-sugar"` feature of the crate, which
shall, in turn, enable the `"full"` features of `::syn` (resulting in a slightly higher
from-scratch compile-time, _should no other crate in the dependency tree have enabled it
already_).

Without it, the `Drop` block and logic would have had to be spelled out a bit more explicitly, like so:

<details class="custom"><summary><span class="summary-box"><span>Click to show</span></span></summary>

```rust
# fn main() {}
#
use ::drop_with_owned_fields::prelude::*;

#[drop_with_owned_fields]
struct Defer<F: FnOnce()> { f: F }

impl<F: FnOnce()> DropWithOwnedFields for Defer<F> {
    fn drop(DestructuredFieldsOf::<Self> { f }: DestructuredFieldsOf<Self>) {
        f(); // âœ…
    }
}
```

or, if the `DestructuredFieldsOf<Self>` stutter is then deemed unÃ¦sthetic:

```rust
# fn main() {}
#
use ::drop_with_owned_fields::prelude::*;

#[drop_with_owned_fields]
struct Defer<F: FnOnce()> { f: F }

impl<F: FnOnce()> DropWithOwnedFields for Defer<F> {
    fn drop(this: DestructuredFieldsOf<Self>) {
        if true {
            // One approachâ€¦
            (this.f)(); // âœ…
        } else {
            // â€¦or another.
            let DestructuredFieldsOf::<Self> { f } = this;
            f(); // âœ…
        }
    }
}
```

  - (the advantage of destructuring is that you can be sure not to be forgetting to properly handle
    some field; with that being said, the "forgotten" fields are still owned in that `fn` body,
    just anonymously (or by `this`), so they get dropped, normally, at the end of the `fn`.)

If you forget to `impl DropWithOwnedFields` (with or without sugar), like so:

```rust ,compile_fail
# use ::drop_with_owned_fields::drop_with_owned_fields;
#
#[drop_with_owned_fields]
struct Example {
    // â€¦
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

you will then get the following compiler error message:

<details class="custom"><summary><span class="summary-box"><span>Click to show</span></span></summary>

<span class="code_with_line_wrap">

```rust ,ignore

          If you have enabled the `"drop-sugar"` Cargo feature, you can even write a direct `impl` of `Drop` instead, but with a `#[drop_with_owned_fields]` annotation on top of it.

### Example: `.transaction.commit()` in `Drop`

<details open class="custom"><summary><span class="summary-box"><span>Click to hide</span></span></summary>

Another case where one may need owned access to a field in drop is when the field is doing its own linear/affine-ish types thing, and having different "destructors" requiring and consuming an owned `self`.

Typically, `transaction` handles do this for their `.commit()` and `.roll_back()` functions:

```rust
use ::drop_with_owned_fields::drop_with_owned_fields;

use example_lib::Transaction;
// where:
mod example_lib {
    pub struct Transaction {
        // â€¦
    }

    impl Transaction {
        /// Owned access required for stronger type-safety ðŸ‘Œ
        pub fn commit(self) {
            // â€¦
        }
    }
}

#[drop_with_owned_fields]
struct CommitOnDrop {
    txn: Transaction,
}

#[drop_with_owned_fields]
impl Drop for CommitOnDrop {
    fn drop(Self { txn }: _) {
        txn.commit(); // âœ…
    }
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

</details>

## Unsugaring

Taking the `Defer<F>` example, for instance, but renamed as Foo:

```rust
#[::drop_with_owned_fields::drop_with_owned_fields]
impl<F: FnOnce()> Drop for Foo<F> {
    fn drop(Self { f }: _) {
        f();
    }
}

#[::drop_with_owned_fields::drop_with_owned_fields]
struct Foo<F: FnOnce()> {
    f: F,
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

unsugars to code along the following lines (papering over robust namespacing and privacy):

```rust
# use ::core::{mem::ManuallyDrop, ops::{Deref, DerefMut}};
# use ::drop_with_owned_fields::prelude::*;
#
/// Unsugaring of the `Drop` impl.
impl<F: FnOnce()> DropWithOwnedFields for Foo<F> {
    fn drop(FooFields { f }: FooFields<F>) {
        f();
    }
}

// == Unsugaring of the `struct Foo` definition: ==

struct FooFields<F: FnOnce()> {
    f: F,
}

/// This is what makes `DestructuredFieldsOf<Foo<F>> == FooFields<F>`.
impl<F: FnOnce()> ::drop_with_owned_fields::DestructureFields for Foo<F> {
    type DestructuredFields = FooFields<F>;
    # fn destructure_fields_disabling_extra_drop(self) -> Self::DestructuredFields { todo!() }
}
# impl<F: FnOnce()> ::drop_with_owned_fields::à¶ž::drop_with_owned_fields_annotation for Foo<F> {}

// The `ManuallyDrop` unsafe-but-sound pattern!
struct Foo<F: FnOnce()> {
    // real fields no longer in the `struct`, but moved to the companion `SelfFields` data type!
    // ðŸ‘‡
    manually_drop_fields: ManuallyDrop<FooFields<F>>,
}
impl<F: FnOnce()> Drop for Foo<F>
where
# /*
    // This is what makes the real `impl Drop` use and require your `DropWithOwned` logic
    //     ðŸ‘‡
    Self : DropWithOwnedFields,
# */
{
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        let fields = unsafe {
            ManuallyDrop::take(&mut self.manually_drop_fields)
        };
        <Self as DropWithOwnedFields>::drop(fields);
    }
}

// -- Niceties --

// -- 1. `.field_name` access sugar:
impl<F: FnOnce()> Deref for Foo<F> {
    type Target = FooFields<F>;
    // â€¦
    # fn deref(&self) -> &FooFields<F> { &self.manually_drop_fields }
}
// Ditto for `DerefMut`

# #[cfg(any())]
// -- 2. Constructor builder/helper
impl<F: FnOnce()> Into<Foo<F>> for FooFields<F> {
    // ...
}
#
# fn main() {}
```

Mainly, notice the very important addition of a "companion `struct`": `FooFields<F>`:

## The companion `struct FooFields<â€¦>`

This is the `struct` containing all of the fields laid out as they initially were for the original
`Foo` definition. The trick having been about splitting the original `Foo` definition (as input to
the macro) into two `struct` definitions:

  - the `FooFields<â€¦>` "copy", which has the fields **but has no extra/customized `Drop` glue nor
    `impl` whatsoever**.

  - the `Foo<â€¦>` original type, which does have the desired extra/customized `Drop impl`, but in
    exchange of that it had to forsake carrying the fields directly, using a
    `ManuallyDrop<FooFields<â€¦>>` layer instead.

More generally, for every `StructName<Genericsâ€¦>`, there shall be a companion
`StructNameFields<Genericsâ€¦>` definition.

  - There is a way to make the attribute name this data structure as _you_ desire: its default name
    can thus be overridden;

  - otherwise, the default name is _currently left unspecified_ (and will probably involve some `à¶ž`
    sigil somewhere in the name to communicate this fact and deter from direct usage).

    Instead, the [`DestructureFields`] `trait` can be used, _especially its
    [`DestructuredFields`] associated type_.

    Or the convenience [`DestructuredFieldsOf<_>`][`DestructuredFieldsOf`] `type` alias:

    ```rust ,ignore
    DestructuredFieldsOf<Foo<F>> = <Foo<F> as DestructureFields>::DestructuredFields
                                 = FooFields<F>
    ```

    This yields a properly specified and usable type name.

It is guaranteed to have the same fields as the original `Foo` definition, in terms of:
  - deconstructing and/or accessing these fields in `Drop` of `Deref{,Mut}`;
  - constructing this `FooFields { â€¦ }` instance, which, as we are about to see, shall be not only
    handy but _paramount_ for the instantiation of a `Foo { â€¦ }` value.

## Braced literal construction of `Foo { â€¦ }`

It is not longer available once the [`#[drop_with_owned_fields]`][`drop_with_owned_fields`] pass has
happened onto `Foo`'s definition.

Indeed, instead, we have something along the lines of:

```rust ,ignore
struct Foo<F> {
    manually_drop_fiels: ManuallyDrop<FooFields<F>>,
}
```

  - (with `.manually_drop_fields` being a field name left _private_);

This, obviously, prevents the "typical" braced-`struct`-literal construction of a `Foo { â€¦ }`.

```rust ,compile_fail
# use ::core::mem::ManuallyDrop;
#
struct FooFields<F: FnOnce()> { f: F }

struct Foo<F: FnOnce()> {
    manually_drop_fiels: ManuallyDrop<FooFields<F>>,
}

let _foo = Foo {
    f: || (),
};
```

<span class="code_with_line_wrap">

```rust ,ignore
# /*
error[E0560]: struct `Foo<_>` has no field named `f`
  --> src/_lib.rs:392:5
   |
12 |     f: || (),
   |     ^ `Foo<_>` does not have this field
   |
# */
```

</span>

Instead, the workaround is to involve the perfectly-available braced-`struct`-literal construction
of the `FooFields { â€¦ } struct` and _its eponymous fields_, and then simply call `.into()` to
convert it "back" into a `Foo { â€¦ }`:

```rust
use ::drop_with_owned_fields::prelude::*;

#[drop_with_owned_fields]
pub struct Defer<F: FnOnce()> {
    f: F,
}

#[drop_with_owned_fields]
impl<F: FnOnce()> Drop for Defer<F> {
    fn drop(Self { f }: _) {
        f();
    }
}

impl<F: FnOnce()> Defer<F> {
    pub fn new(f: F) -> Self {
        DestructuredFieldsOf::<Self> { f }.into() // ðŸ‘ˆ
    }
}

fn main() {
    let _defer = Defer::new(|| println!("General Kenobi."));
    println!("Hello, there!");
}
```

## Renaming the companion `struct`

Since having to type `DestructuredFieldsOf<Foo<F>>` all the time can be deemed cumbersome, and
noisy, the [`#[drop_with_owned_fields]`][`drop_with_owned_fields`] attribute accepts an optional
attribute arg to:
- both override the  name of that companion struct,
- and adjust its visibility so that it be allowed to be fully `pub`lic should the author with so:

```rust
use ::drop_with_owned_fields::prelude::*;

#[drop_with_owned_fields(
    pub type FooFields = DestructuredFieldsOf<Self>,
)]
pub struct Foo<F: FnOnce()> { f: F }

impl<F: FnOnce()> DropWithOwnedFields for Foo<F> {
    fn drop(FooFields { f }: FooFields<F>) {
        f(); // âœ…
    }
}
#
# fn main() {}
```
